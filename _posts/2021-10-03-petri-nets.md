# Petri Nets

Petri nets are used to model collections of interdependent processes.

Their original formulation was used to study chemical reactions in which some processes produce compounds that are then consumed by other processes, possibly in complex, cyclical ways.

There have been many proposed semantics for petri nets

- A SHEAF SEMANTICS FOR PETRI NETS [@liliusSHEAFSEMANTICSPETRI]
- ON THE STRUCTURE OF HIGH-LEVEL NETS [@liliusSTRUCTUREHIGHLEVELNETS]
- A Trace Semantics for Petri Nets [@hoogersTraceSemanticsPetri1995]
- On the semantics of Petri Nets [@meseguerSemanticsPetriNets1992]
- Petri nets are monoids [@meseguerPetriNetsAre1990]
- Petri nets based on Lawvere theories [@masterPetriNetsBased2020]
