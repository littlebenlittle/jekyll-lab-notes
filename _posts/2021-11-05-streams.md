## Problem Statement

Consider a stream that has produced the following sequence of values:

```
0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5
```

What might we assume about the future values?

1. When a non-0 value is observed, the next value will be 0
2. When the value 0 is observed, the next value will be one greater than the previous value.

These observations can be formalized into predicates over future sequences of symbols.

1. `∀ t. σₜ ≠ 0 ⇒ σₜ₊₁ = 0`
2. `∀ t. σₜ = 0 ⇒ σₜ₊₁ = σₜ₋₁ + 1`

The problem here is to use previously observed sequences of values to infer predicates over future sequences of values.

## Formalization

Inputs:

* an alphabet of symbols `Σ`
* a stream `s ∈ S` of time-indexed symbols `σₜ ∈ Σ`
* a space of theories `T` where a theory `θ ∈ T` is a collection of inference rules `P₁(σₜ₋ₙ, ... , σₜ) ⊢ P₂(σₜ₊₁, ... , σₜ₊ₖ)`
* a totally ordered collection `Ω` and metric `μ: T → Ω` whose value measures the effectiveness of theories in `T` at predicting the output

A typical metric for the effectiveness of a theory might be

1. Select a collection of sequences for validation
2. For each validation sequence, apply the theory to some prefix of the sequence in order to predict the entire sequence
3. Count the number of near-matches that that the theory produced, given some definition of nearness for sequences of characters
