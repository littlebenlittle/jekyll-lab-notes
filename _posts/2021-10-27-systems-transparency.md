## Goals

### Talking Points

- Making software transparent
- Trust in software and hardware

### Introduction

In order to engage meaningfully with a computational system, the workings of that system must be transparent.

Consider

- a [gig economy ride-sharing application](/2021/10/27/gig-economy-example.html)
- a [network voting system](/2021/10/27/voting-example.html)

In both cases, non-technical stakeholders need deep insight into the technical workings of a system in order to assess whether or not that system is performing in accordance with their expectations.

#### Confidence in Systems

- push and pray: dev doesn't even know if it works
- unit tests: the components work in some cases
- functional tests: the components work together in some places
- assertions: some smart people say the components works in all cases
- explainable assertions: assertions that can be mechanically demonstrated to a non-technical audience

## Human Problems

- Technical education is a [high barrier to entry](/2021/10/28/technical-equity.html) for designing important systems.
- We need [more brain power](/2021/10/27/social-intelligence.html) to solve hard problems.
- It is difficult to [verify the authenticity](/2021/10/28/data-supply-chain.html) of data received over a network
