## Designing complex systems is hard

#### Evidence

1. Despite many [proposed forms of governance](https://github.com/thelastjosh/govbase), very few have been implemented to a wide scale
2. Even expensive complex systems fail. Think how many times DNS issues have taken down half the internet.

#### Solution

> we need a simple yet powerful way to verify high-level designs.

My proposed solution is a [graphical calculus](/2021/10/24/graphical-calculus.html) for describing interacting systems. The calculus should be powerful enough to express any formal property, yet intuitive enough that non-technical users can still meaningfully engage with the components that matter most to them.

This graphical calculus extends to UI component design, so people can have confidence that the application is applying their input exactly as given.

## Discussion

> Optimal distribution of shared resources within complex interacting systems

It is not unreasonable to think that this could be the fundamental problem statement for humans on earth today. Problems of this form have grown and toppled nations, ignited wars, and are the concern of many global research endeavors.

In the realm of computation, Devops and Site Reliability engineers have discovered general patterns and found success in applying those patterns to global-scale problems. However, these high-profile incidents â€¦ demonstrate that we must expand the brain pool even further if we want to tackle even larger and more important SRIS problems.
