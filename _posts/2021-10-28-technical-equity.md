At the moment, the design and control of socially important systems rests with the select few who have the required education to understand the technology. Given the conditions of the world today, access to such an education is tightly coupled with socioeconomic status. This leads to a vicious cycle where those with the power to produce and control technology have economic incentive to use that technology as a means to extract resources from those without such power.

This dynamic has already led to multiple high-profile incidents where users' rights and expecatations were violated intentionally or unintentionally by a platform developer â€¦ (cambridge analyica, experian hack, etc)

If we desire more democratic control of socially necessary infrastructure, then we need to empower all people to engage meaningfully with the design and governance of the tools that they use.
