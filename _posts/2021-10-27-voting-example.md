Consider an organization that wants to offer online voting to its members.

Members devices need to be able to collect their vote securely and transmit it over the internet to central processing for aggregation.

Given the importance of such a system, its components need to be transparent.

However the technical details of transmitting information over a network are not accessible to the intended user.

Unless that understanding gap can be bridged, it will not be possible to win the trust of organization memebers.
