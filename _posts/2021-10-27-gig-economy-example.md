There are three broad groups of stakeholders, each with their own primary concerns

#### Agents and Actions

1. **Riders** want to make use of the service to get from A to B
2. **Drivers** want to offer the service in order to collect fees
3. **Developers** want to facilitate the above exchange and collect a transaction fee

In order to assess whether or no their goals are being met, each type of stakeholder needs insight into the technical workings of the application. However only the Developers really have access to that information, both in terms of authorization and technical capacity.

This leads to an unbalanced power dynamic where Developers are more likely to have their needs met, followed by riders, and then by drivers.

Given the social importance of such an application in organizing human endeavors, transparency into the system is vital.

This transparency is fundamentally blocked by the gap in technical knowledge between developers and the other two groups.
