## problem you'd like to solve

#### Basic

Define a simplified imperative language for computation in the style of python or julia.

The language should support [floating point arithmetic](https://coq.inria.fr/library/Coq.Floats.PrimFloat.html).

##### Bonus

Support vector operations, rather than 1D

#### Intermediate

Prove that the [leapfrog integrator](http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~steve/Courses/Comp_Phys/Integrators/leapfrog/) is time-reversible, i.e.

```
   [X=x  P=p  ] fn [X=x' P=p']
-> [X=x' P=-p'] fn [X=x  P=p ]
```

#### Stretch goal

Verify safety properties for a difference equation of an inverse square force law (ISFL) in Classical Mechanics.

Show that the orbit follows a conic section trajectory +/- some variation.

## why it is interesting

Naive numeric solutions to differential equations (such as Runge-Kutta and Newton's method) do not preserve invariants, leading to systematic error.

Reversible integrators preserve time-invariants and are [used in production systems](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/e62e20f3852f28c79c7dcdb2761ed1ddf8affb9b/tensorflow_probability/python/mcmc/internal/leapfrog_integrator.py).

## outline intended deliverables

- [ ] create (or find) a small imperative language capable of floating point arithmetic
- [ ] create a command that computes one step of leapfrog integration
- [ ] use hoare logic to verify that this operator is time-reversible, i.e. `cmd(x,p) = (x',p') -> cmd(x',-p') = (x,p)`
- [ ] if the above have been done well, apply integrator to the solution of ISFL
