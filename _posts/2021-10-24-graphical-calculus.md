### Concept Map ([Cmap](https://cmap.ihmc.us/))



## Desirable Properties

- self-documenting, a la [nota](https://willcrichton.net/nota/)
- collapse collections of components, to abstract info irrelevant to the analysis
- expand components, to specify info relevant to the analysis
- predicates on relationships

## Questions

- Can we give a categorical/logical semantics to these diagrams?
- How do we prove bisimulation between the diagram and what actually happens?
