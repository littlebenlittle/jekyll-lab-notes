## Inter Planetary Linked Data

IPLD is a standard empowering systems to request and receive data over untrusted and even adversarial networks.

### How IPLD works

### Limitations of IPLD

You can only request data that you already know the hash of. This makes it hard to introduce new data to the system. Who do you trust to provide you with the correct hash of the data mathching a semantic request?

## A a capability based ad-hoc service network

Suppose an IoT device needs to outsource a computation and a nearby peer offers compute services. The IoT device checks its local cache for a valid proof of capability for the service provider. If it finds one, the computation can be outsourced immediately. If the IoT device does not have a valid proof, it can request the service provider validate its capabilities with a trusted capability validation authority. The service provider can then reach out to the validation authority and negotiate a proof of capability for the requested computation. The service provider then gives the CID of the proof to the IoT device. The IoT device resolves the CID, yielding a valid proof of capability. Now the outsourced computation can proceed.

Peer caching creates several opportunities to short-circuit this process and reduce unecessary hops and computations.
